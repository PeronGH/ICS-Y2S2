    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for taking this course. Its purpose is to introduce you to the fundamentals of computer programming and to build your confidence in self-study. For the duration of the course we will be covering general programming concepts and structures which are not exclusive to Python and exist in other programming languages as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Why Python\n",
    "For many people, the Python programming lanugage has strong appeal. Since it first appeared in 1991, Python has become one of the most important programming languages today. Among interpreted languages, for various historical and cultural reasons, Python has developed a large and active scientific computing and data analysis community. In the last 10 years, Python has gone from bleeding-edge and experimental to one of the most important languages for data science machine learning and general software development in academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a lot of versatile tools for data science which are added in the form of packages. Some of the most popular ones are NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels and others. For this course though, we will be covering the basic foundation of Python and some most popular packages named NumPy and pandas.\n",
    "## 1.2. Course structure\n",
    "This is a taught course but the notebooks can also be studied independently. During teaching particular examples will be given directly out of the notebooks. You are expected to follow the instructor whilist running all code blocks by yourself.\n",
    "The course will last for about 1h. Each of the sessions will be split into teaching and exercises at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Ask\n",
    "**The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Thomas Berger\n",
    "\n",
    "This course should be more of a conversation, therefore do not hesitate to ask for questions. The demonstrators are there to help you during exercises as well. Furthermore you can also ask other people within the course for help and advice!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4. Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is all about failure and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you would have to fail several times before making something work but after that you can redo it immediately. That being said, do not be afraid to experiment and fail! Often a useful error message will be printed which will help you solve the issue.\n"
